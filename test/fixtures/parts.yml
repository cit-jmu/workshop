# Read about fixtures at http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/FixtureSet.html
#
# The fixtures for the parts are commented out here since they have specific
# dates in them, and some of the tests are dependent on certain date values.
# Which means that if any tests depend on these fixtures, they may break
# simply due to the fact that time has passes since the fixtures were updated,
# and have no relevance on the test actually breaking.
#
# So I think a better workflow is to not use fixtures for parts, but rather
# create parts in the tests when they are needed, with relative date values
# so the tests will be consistent.
